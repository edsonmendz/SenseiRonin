## 💼 The Solution: Beyond Social Media
The client’s pain point was the lack of a truly personalized online identity. I developed a custom **React** application that allows for a unique storytelling experience, reflecting the Sensei's philosophy in a way that standard platforms cannot.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** React.js
- **Development Strategy:** **Mobile-First Approach**, ensuring a seamless experience on smartphones before scaling to desktop.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS/Modules for a unique visual identity.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on **Vercel**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Tailored UI/UX:** A non-linear, custom layout designed specifically for the client's brand.
- **High Performance:** Optimized React components for fast loading and smooth navigation.
- **Full Responsiveness:** Optimized for all screen sizes with a focus on mobile users.
